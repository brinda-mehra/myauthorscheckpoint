Checkpoint for 507 Submission
This is a checkpoint for my 507 Final Project. This program scrapes data from GoodReads to provide users with the following options: 
1: Visualize all your author searches and their influences
2: Find out which genres your last search is primarily defined by 
3: Open up your last search's personal website 
4: Open up your last search's Amazon search 
5: Create a cache of all your searches with all their details
